# MAIS202 Project: Social Media-Enabled Crisis Informatics

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and implementation for the MAIS202 project. 
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning application focused on **social media-enabled crisis informatics**.

## Features
- Classification of crisis-related information, such as infrastructure damage, casualties, and donation needs.
- Built using Python and machine learning libraries.

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Main application file containing the codebase for data processing and model inference.
- Additional files may include datasets and model scripts.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` for a full list):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - PyTorch
